      "GENERAL QUESTIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: What makes the QuantumFlow Smart Water Purifier \"smart\"?\n",
      "A1: The QuantumFlow QF-2025 is smart due to its AI-powered monitoring system, real-time water quality analysis, filter life prediction, and seamless integration with the \"QuantumFlow Connect\" mobile app. This allows for remote control, usage tracking, and intelligent alerts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: What type of filtration does the QuantumFlow use?\n",
      "A2: The QF-2025 utilizes a multi-stage purification process including Reverse Osmosis (RO), Ultraviolet (UV), Ultrafiltration (UF), and an Alkaline Enhancer for superior water quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q3: What is the storage capacity of the QuantumFlow?\n",
      "A3: The QuantumFlow QF-2025 has a purified water storage tank capacity of 7 liters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Test Query 3: I just installed my new QuantumFlow purifier, but the water flow is very slow. What could be the potential reasons for this issue, and what's the first step I should take?\n",
      "Found 1 relevant chunks.\n",
      "  Chunk 1 (Source: ./data\\QuantumFlow_FAQ.txt):\n",
      "    Content: Q11: What should I do if the water flow is very slow?\n",
      "A11: Slow water flow can indicate several issues:\n",
      "1. Clogged Filters: Check the filter status indicators. If yellow or red, filters need replacement.\n",
      "2. Low Input Water Pressure: Ensure your main water supply is fully open and has adequate pressure.\n",
      "3. Air Lock: Sometimes, air trapped in the system can cause slow flow. Try turning the unit off and on, and dispensing water a few times.\n",
      "4. RO Membrane Issue: If other filters are fine, the RO membrane might be clogged, especially with hard water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Refer to the \"QuantumFlow Troubleshooting Guide\" for more detailed steps.\n",

      "\n",
      "2.  INCORRECT PAIRING PROCEDURE:\n",
      "    * Solution: Refer to Section 6.1 in the User Manual (\"Smart Features & App Integration\") for detailed pairing instructions. Ensure you are pressing the Wi-Fi button on the purifier for the correct duration.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  ROUTER OR INTERNET ISSUES:\n",
      "    * Solution: Restart your Wi-Fi router. Check if your internet connection is working normally for other devices.\n",
