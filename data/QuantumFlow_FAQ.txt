MAINTENANCE & TROUBLESHOOTING

Q9: How often do I need to replace the filters?
A9: Filter replacement frequency varies based on input water quality and usage. Generally, filters should be replaced every 6-12 months, or when indicated by the mobile app or the purifier's LED filter status indicators (yellow/red light).

Q10: Where can I buy replacement filters?
A10: Genuine QuantumFlow replacement filters can be purchased directly from our official website (www.quantumflow.com/shop) or authorized dealers. Refer to your user manual for correct filter model numbers (e.g., QF-SF01, QF-RO01).

Q11: What should I do if the water flow is very slow?
A11: Slow water flow can indicate several issues:
1. Clogged Filters: Check the filter status indicators. If yellow or red, filters need replacement.
2. Low Input Water Pressure: Ensure your main water supply is fully open and has adequate pressure.
3. Air Lock: Sometimes, air trapped in the system can cause slow flow. Try turning the unit off and on, and dispensing water a few times.
4. RO Membrane Issue: If other filters are fine, the RO membrane might be clogged, especially with hard water.

Refer to the "QuantumFlow Troubleshooting Guide" for more detailed steps.

Q12: Why does my purified water taste strange?
A12: A strange taste can occur if:
1. New Filters: A slight taste might be present immediately after installing new filters; flush the system for 15-20 minutes.
2. Expired Filters: Filters, especially the carbon filter, might be exhausted. Replace them.
3. Contamination: Ensure the storage tank and dispensing area are clean.

Q13: My app is not connecting to the purifier. What should I do?
A13:
1. Ensure your Wi-Fi router is working and the purifier is within range.
2. Restart your phone, the app, and the QuantumFlow purifier.
