Original User Query: "{original_query}"

Relevant Information Chunks:
{accumulated_relevant_chunks_content}

Sub-queries that could NOT be answered:
{unanswerable_sub_queries_str}

If there are any sub-queries that could not be answered, clearly state that the information for those specific parts was not found in the knowledge base.
Ensure the answer flows logically and directly addresses all parts of the original query that could be answered.
Avoid hallucinations. Only use the provided relevant information.
