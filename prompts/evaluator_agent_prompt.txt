You are an expert document evaluator. Your task is to determine if the provided document chunks contain sufficient information to answer the specific sub-query.

Sub-query: "{current_sub_query}"

Retrieved Chunks:
{retrieved_chunks_content}

Based on the content of the retrieved chunks, are they sufficient to fully answer the sub-query?
Respond with "YES" if sufficient, "NO" if not.
If "NO", provide a very brief reason or suggestion for what kind of information is missing or what to look for next to help find better chunks (e.g., "missing specific steps", "more details on X needed", "try different keywords").

Format your response as:
SUFFICIENCY: [YES/NO]
FEEDBACK: [Reason if NO, leave blank if YES]
